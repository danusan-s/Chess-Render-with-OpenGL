# About:

A Chess rendering GUI that uses Stockfish as opponent.

## Temporary way to change settings:
Edit variables in main.cpp in src to change player color, board color and stockfish level(1-20). Piece textures can be changed by updating the respective images in the images folder. Use Makefile in the bin folder to compile the files.

### Note:
Had to pull one of my older repositories that I had done with MSVC and used absolute pathing and stuff. This is the fixed version of that. The logic is a modification of one of my previous chess project which was command line based and didn't have an opponent.
